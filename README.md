This repository is an educational project focused on exploring the structure and evolution of computing systems.  
It starts from the historical roots — from the Abacus to transistors — and aims to build a working computer based on relays.

The provided text “From the Abacus to the Transistor: The Path of Computation” serves as an introductory overview and is not required for following the technical documentation.
